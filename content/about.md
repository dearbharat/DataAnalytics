I am a full stack data scientist harvesting data from its origin in raw form to finished end product in form of insights and strategy. Be it conventional statistics or modern data mining algorithms, I apply what is necessary to solve the problem.

As a Practitioner, I have worked on several commercially deployable machine learning models such as automated risk underwriting for an insurance company, financial product recommender system for a bank, Comprehensive automated student feedback system etc.

As a coach, I conduct training using R, Python, Tableau etc. to conduct data analysis, data visualization and designing dashboards for working executives regularly.

As an academic, I teach Business Statistics,Marketing Analytics, Machine Learning and Advanced Multivariate analysis for undergraduates and graduates in school of Business.
